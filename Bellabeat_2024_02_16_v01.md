Bella Beat Case Study
================

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*SjEGKrjDp7skk4URhzW5Nw.png)

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that
manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as
an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and
inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep,
stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women
with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded
in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a
tech-driven wellness company for women.

By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched
multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing
number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel
on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising
media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but
focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round
in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and
consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs
video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to
support campaigns around key marketing dates.

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data
would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing
analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device
usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using
their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like
high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat
marketing strategy.

## 1. Ask

Therefore, data analysis is needed to know trends and behavior of the
users. We can extract some information from the raw data and help us to
improve the sales performance. We use the data from other company called
FitBit, fitness tracker smartwatch producer. Bellabeat also produce
fitness tracker, but in different types of devices. One device that is
really popular is Bellabeat leaf, the Bellabeat’s classic wellness
tracker which can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf
tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and
stress.

Sršen asks us to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain
insight into how consumers use FitBit smart devices. She then wants us
to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in the
presentation. These questions will guide our analysis:

- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## 2. Prepare

Sršen told us to use the data sets from smartwatch company, FitBit. We
can download the data
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data). The data
sets licensed under the CCO Public Domain, which we can copy, modify,
distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all
without asking permission.

This data set generated by respondents to a distributed survey via
Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible
Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data,
including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and
sleep monitoring.

The data sets consist of 18 different data sets.
![](F:/Data%20Analytics/Case%20Studies/Bellabeat/images/fitbit-datasets.png)

There were three files containing wide tables, and they contained the
same values as the long tables. The **dailyactivity** table already
contained the values in **dailycalories**, **dailyintensities** and
**dailysteps** tables, so we also did not use these three tables. We had
**33** different samples in **dailyactivity**, **hourlycalories**,
**hourlyintensities**, **hourlysteps**, **minutescaloriesnarrow**,
**minutesmetsnarrow**, **minutesstepsnarrow**, and
**minutesintensitiesnarrow**. We had fewer samples in other data sets,
**24** different samples in **minutessleepmerged** and **sleepday**,
**14** samples in **heartrateseconds**, and **8** different samples in
**weightloginfo**. We only used the datasets that contained 33 different
samples. Thus, We only used 8 of 18 for this analysis. Data sets
contained information such as:

- Number of steps
- Number of calories
- Active Minutes
- METs, a ratio of working metabolic rate relative to your resting
  metabolic rate.
- Intensities

## 3. Process

We did all the analysis using RStudio, starting from importing,
cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and reporting. We only used data sets
with long tables. we import them to RStudio using `read_csv` function
from `readr` package.

``` r
dailyactivity <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
hourlycalories <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourlyintensities <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourlysteps <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
minutescaloriesnarrow <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv")
minutesintensitiesnarrow <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv")
minutesmetsnarrow <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
minutesstepsnarrow <- read_csv("F:/Data Analytics/Case Studies/Bellabeat/Data Sets/minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv")
```

After all the data have been imported, we did some cleaning processes.

### 3.1. Cleaning

#### 3.1.1. Converting Data Type from String to Date

The data sets we use here were imported from external sources, so we
might have found any issues with the data sets. Here, we found out that
the data type for the date columns was in string or character data type,
and some data sets had date and hours combined in one column. We changed
the data type in the date column in every data set from string or
character to date. We also split date and time values into two separate
columns. We use the `mutate` function from the `dplyr` package to
perform this action.

``` r
#dailyactivity
dailyactivity <- 
  dailyactivity %>% 
  mutate(ActivityDate = mdy(ActivityDate))   #convert date columns into date data type

#hourlycalories
hourlycalories<-
  hourlycalories %>% 
  mutate(ActivityHour = mdy_hms(ActivityHour),                                  #convert date columns into date data type 
         ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityHour),                                  #create a date column
         ActivityHour = hms::as_hms(format(ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S"))) #create an hour column
```

We wrote the same codes and method to clean and separate date and time
for the other data sets. We only showed the codes sample above to show
you the functions and the package we used.

#### 3.1.2. Removing Duplicates and Outliers

##### 3.1.2.1. Duplicates

We checked if there were any duplicates in each data set with the codes
below:

``` r
sum(duplicated(dailyactivity))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(hourlycalories))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(hourlyintensities))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(hourlysteps))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(minutescaloriesnarrow)) 
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(minutesmetsnarrow))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(minutesstepsnarrow))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(duplicated(minutesintensitiesnarrow))
```

    ## [1] 0

No duplicates found in the data sets.

##### 3.1.2.2. Outliers

We found outliers in one of the data sets. In the *dailyactivity* table,
there was a column called *SedentaryMinutes*. In that column, we found
values returned the number of *1440*. Sedentary minutes meant the amount
of time (in minutes) the users use for not doing anything (sitting
still, laying down, or sleeping). It did not make sense, because *1440*
meant people doing nothing for 24 hours. We marked this as ourliers and
we need to filter the data set from these values. Therefore, we updated
the data set with these codes below:

``` r
#removing values 1440 in dailyactivity data set
daily <-
  dailyactivity %>% 
  filter(!SedentaryMinutes >= 1440 & !TotalSteps == 0) 
```

### 3.2. Creating **hourlyactivity** and **minutesactivity** Table

All the data sets had been cleaned from the duplicates and outliers.
Now, we could do a further analysis and see the patterns and trends in
the data sets. We created some new tables by performing `inner_join`
function from the `dplyr` package.

We created three new tables for further analysis, they were:

- *hourlyactivity*, made from *hourlycalories*, *hourlyintensities*,
  *hourlysteps*
- *minutesactivity*, made from *minutescaloriesnarrow*,
  *minutesmetsnarrow*, *minutesstepsnarrow*, and
  *minutesintensitiesnarrow*

#### 3.2.1. **hourlyactivity** Table

``` r
#Creating New Data Set called hourlyactivity
hourlyactivity <- 
  hourlycalories %>% 
  inner_join(hourlyintensities, by = c("Id", "ActivityDate", "ActivityHour")) %>%
  inner_join(hourlysteps, by = c("Id", "ActivityDate", "ActivityHour"))
kable(head(hourlyactivity))
```

|         Id | ActivityHour | Calories | ActivityDate | TotalIntensity | AverageIntensity | StepTotal |
|-----------:|:-------------|---------:|:-------------|---------------:|-----------------:|----------:|
| 1503960366 | 00:00:00     |       81 | 2016-04-12   |             20 |         0.333333 |       373 |

| 1503960366 | 03:00:00     |       47 | 2016-04-12   |              0 |         0.000000 |         0 |
| 1503960366 | 04:00:00     |       48 | 2016-04-12   |              0 |         0.000000 |         0 |
| 1503960366 | 05:00:00     |       48 | 2016-04-12   |              0 |         0.000000 |         0 |

#### 3.2.2. **minutesactivity** Table

``` r
#Creating New Data Set called minutesactivity
minutesactivity <-
  minutescaloriesnarrow %>%
  inner_join(minutesintensitiesnarrow, by = c("Id", "ActivityDate", "ActivityMinute")) %>%
  inner_join(minutesmetsnarrow, by = c("Id", "ActivityDate", "ActivityMinute")) %>%
  inner_join(minutesstepsnarrow, by = c("Id", "ActivityDate", "ActivityMinute"))
kable(head(minutesactivity))
```

|         Id | ActivityMinute | Calories | ActivityDate | Intensity | METs | Steps |
|-----------:|:---------------|---------:|:-------------|----------:|-----:|------:|
| 1503960366 | 00:00:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   10 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:01:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   10 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:02:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   10 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:03:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   10 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:04:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   10 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:05:00       |   0.9438 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |   12 |     0 |

A MET is a ratio of your working metabolic rate relative to your resting
metabolic rate. Somehow, the values of METS in this data set seems
wrong. METs value when a person taking a rest or sitting still is 1.0,
but in this data set, the value return 10. So, we need to divide METs
values in the column by 10

``` r
minutesactivity<-
  minutesactivity %>% mutate(METs = METs/10)
kable(head(minutesactivity))
```

|         Id | ActivityMinute | Calories | ActivityDate | Intensity | METs | Steps |
|-----------:|:---------------|---------:|:-------------|----------:|-----:|------:|
| 1503960366 | 00:00:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.0 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:01:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.0 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:02:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.0 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:03:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.0 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:04:00       |   0.7865 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.0 |     0 |
| 1503960366 | 00:05:00       |   0.9438 | 2016-04-12   |         0 |  1.2 |     0 |

## 4. Analysis

### 4.1. Frequency Level

This analysis showed us how often people in the samples wear their smart
devices. We made three different group, based on the frequency level.

- Light, wear their smartdevices less than ten times in a month
- Moderate, wear their smartdevices less between eleven and twenty in a
  month
- Active, wear their smartdevices more than twenty times in a month

We performed this action using the codes below.

``` r
#aggregating the total device uses per Id
frequencylevel <- 
  daily %>% 
  group_by(Id) %>% 
  summarise(Total = n()) %>%
  
#grouping people based on the frequency level
  mutate(Level = case_when(
    Total <= 10 ~ "Light",
    Total > 10 & Total <= 20 ~ "Moderate",
    Total > 20 & Total <= 31 ~ "Active")) %>%
  
#counting members by frequency level
  group_by(Level) %>%
  summarise(Total = n())
```

| Level    | Total |
|:---------|------:|
| Active   |    25 |
| Light    |     1 |
| Moderate |     7 |

We also found that sometimes people turned on their smart devices but
forgot to wear them. The devices recorded activity without being worn.
As we knew earlier in the cleaning process, we deleted some outliers,
which were observations that contained 1440 values in the column
*SedentaryMinutes* in the **dailyactivity** table. Those observations
could be used to calculate how often the users had forgotten to wear
their devices. We use the codes below to perform the analysis.

``` r
#counting how many times devices are not worn
dailyactivity <-
  dailyactivity %>% 
  mutate(Status = case_when((SedentaryMinutes >= 1440 & TotalSteps == 0) ~ "Not Worn",.default = "Worn")) 

#totalnotworn
totalnotworn <-
  dailyactivity %>%
  group_by(Status) %>%
  summarise(Total = n())

#pivoting to show the data clearer
kable(head(totalnotworn %>%pivot_wider(names_from = "Status",values_from = "Total") %>% replace_na(list(Worn = 0, NotWorn = 0))))
```

| Not Worn | Worn |
|---------:|-----:|
|       72 |  868 |

### 4.2. Counting TOtal Devices Use Per Day

We wanted to know how many devices used per day. We grouped the data by
days, and aggregated a total use column with the codes below.

``` r
#Aggregating Total Device Use Per Day
totaluseperday<-
  daily %>% 
  mutate(Day = wday(ActivityDate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(Day) %>% 
  summarise(Total = n())

kable(head(totaluseperday %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "Day", values_from = "Total")))
```

| Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat |
|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| 109 | 109 | 135 | 138 | 133 | 120 | 112 |

### 4.3. Summarizing Variables That Might Defined Physical Fitness

We noticed that **dailyactivity** table did not contain variables like
METs, and Intensity. These two variables were located in two different
tables, METs values were located in the **minutesactivity** table and
intensity values were located in the **hourlyactivity** table. We wanted
to perform analysis based on all variables, so we needed to join the
table and summarized all of them. We grouped the results based on the
*ActivityDate*.

``` r
#summarizing variables in daily table
dailysummary <-
  daily %>% group_by(ActivityDate) %>%
  summarise(TotalDistance = sum(TotalDistance),
            TotalVeryActiveDistance = sum(VeryActiveDistance),
            TotalModeratelyActiveDistance = sum(ModeratelyActiveDistance),
            TotalLightActiveDistance = sum(LightActiveDistance),
            TotalSedentaryActiveDistance = sum(SedentaryActiveDistance),
            TotalVeryActiveMinutes = sum(VeryActiveMinutes),
            TotalFairlyActiveMinutes = sum(FairlyActiveMinutes),
            TotalLightlyActiveMinutes = sum(LightlyActiveMinutes)) 

#summarizing variables in hourlyactivity table
hourlysummary <-
  hourlyactivity %>% group_by(ActivityDate) %>%
  summarise(TotalIntensity = sum(TotalIntensity))

#summarizing variables in minutesactivity table
minutessummary <-
  minutesactivity %>% group_by(ActivityDate) %>%
  summarise(TotalMETs = sum(METs),
            TotalCalories = sum(Calories),
            TotalSteps = sum(Steps))

#creating summary table
summary <- 
  dailysummary %>% 
  inner_join(hourlysummary, by = c("ActivityDate")) %>%
  inner_join(minutessummary, by = c("ActivityDate"))

kable(head(summary))
```

| ActivityDate | TotalDistance | TotalVeryActiveDistance | TotalModeratelyActiveDistance | TotalLightActiveDistance | TotalSedentaryActiveDistance | TotalVeryActiveMinutes | TotalFairlyActiveMinutes | TotalLightlyActiveMinutes | TotalIntensity | TotalMETs | TotalCalories | TotalSteps |

| 2016-04-16   |        197.18 |                   63.80 |                         22.68 |                   110.42 |                         0.05 |                    891 |                      484 |                      6202 |           9843 |   68737.3 |      75885.14 |     272132 |
| 2016-04-17   |        142.95 |                   36.65 |                         15.92 |                    90.31 |                         0.02 |                    605 |                      379 |                      5291 |           7864 |   64365.0 |      70976.37 |     202044 |

Now, we had established a perfect **summary** table for further
analysis; this table included values of:

- Distance
- Active Minutes
- Calories
- METs
- Intensity

Later on, in the visualization process, we would visualize scatterplots
based on the values from the **summary** table, including:

- Total Steps vs Total Calories
- Total Distance vs Total Calories
- Total Active Minutes vs Total Calories
- Total Intensity vs Total Calories
- Total METs vs Total Calories

### 4.4. METs

In the **minutesactivity** table, we could see METs values. MET stands
for the metabolic equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy
used while sitting quietly. Physical activities may be rated using METs
to indicate their intensity. For example, reading may use about 1.3 METs
while running may use 8-9 METs. METs can also be translated into light,
moderate, and vigorous intensities of exercise.

- Sedentary — Uses 1.5 or fewer METs. Examples are sitting, reclining,
  or lying down.
- Light intensity — Uses from 1.6-3.0 METs. Examples are walking at a
  leisurely pace or standing in line at the store.
- Moderate intensity — Uses from 3.0-6.0 METs. Examples are walking
  briskly, vacuuming, or raking leaves.
- Vigorous intensity — Uses from 6.0+ METs. Examples are walking very
  quickly, running, taking an aerobics class, or shoveling snow.

If you are more curious with the information, you can read full article
[here](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/staying-active/).

From **minutesactivity** table, we grouped the data based on the METs
level or status.

As a baseline, the NHS recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity
activity a week. This is as well as ‘strengthening activities that work
all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and
arms) on at least 2 days a week.’ But how you fill those activity
minutes is really up to you. For more information, you can read this
[article](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/strength-training/a706472/what-is-better-cardio-or-weights/).

Now, we grouped people based on that theory.

``` r
#Grouping people based on Physical Activity Target
activitytarget <-
  pivotstatusmets %>% 
  mutate(Week = week(ActivityDate)-14) %>% 
  group_by(Id, Week) %>%
  summarise(MinutesVigorous = sum(MinutesVigorous),
            MinutesModerate = sum(MinutesModerate)) %>%
  mutate(Status = case_when(MinutesVigorous + MinutesModerate >= 150 ~ "Achieved!",
                             .default = "Do More Exercise!")) %>%
  select(Id, Week, Status) %>% 
  arrange(Id)

#pivoting tables to see clearer result
kable(head(activitytarget %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Week, values_from = Status, names_prefix = "Week")))
```

## 5. Visualization

### 5.1. Frequency Level

This chart visualized total number of smart devices use.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/frequency%20level%20chart-1.png)<!-- -->

### 5.2. People Forgot to Wear Their Devices

Sometimes, people had the smart devices on but forgot not to wear them.
This chart showed us the number of people who didn’t wear their devices
when their devices were turned on.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/not%20worn%20chart-1.png)<!-- -->

And this heatmap showed us more detailed information. X-axis showed us
the time and the Y-axis showed us the Id or the users. Orange meant they
wore their smart devices, while red meant they forgot to wear them.

### 5.3. Total Use Per Day

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Use%20Per%20Day%20Chart-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on the chart above, we saw devices has been used more on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday.

### 5.4. Scatterplots

In the analysis step, we created a summary table. Now, we would use that
table to find the corellation between one variables with another.

#### 5.4.1. Total Steps vs Calories

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Steps%20vs%20Calories-1.png)<!-- -->

### 5.4.2. Total Distance vs Calories

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Distance%20vs%20Calories-1.png)<!-- -->

#### 5.4.3. Total Active Minutes vs Calories

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Active%20Minutes%20vs%20Calories-1.png)<!-- -->

### 5.4.4. Total Intensity vs Calories

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Intensity%20vs%20Calories-1.png)<!-- -->

### 5.4.5. Total METs vs Calories

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20METs%20vs%20Calories-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on the scatter plots above, we concluded that METs were the
variable that had the strongest positive correlation to the calories
burned. Other variables also have a positive correlation, but the
confidence level was just too low.

We could rely on those variables to maintain our fitness level. We know
that the WHO recommends people walk from 8000 - to 10000 steps a day,
and it is true that steps affect the number of calories burned. Somehow,
people, in general, do not know if the theory is not 100 percent
correct. It is not the steps that make us healthy, but the activities.
The intensity of the activities can be measured with MET. As we
explained before in this notebook, MET stands for the metabolic
equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy used while sitting
quietly. Physical activities may be rated using MET to indicate their
intensity.

Walking itself has a rate of 2.5 in MET, Which boosts our metabolism 2.5
times higher compared to when we’re sitting still or doing nothing.
Running and other activities like sports and workouts have higher MET
value. It tells us the reason why MET have a strong correlation with the
calories burned. If you are active, then you don’t need to take
thousands steps a day.

Time and the numbers of step does not matter, as long as we do physical
activities in higher MET and burned more calories than our basal
metabolic rate, it’s enough. People who lift weigth for less than an
hour has better calories burned than people who walk for more than two
hours.

Because of that, we did more analysis regarding the MET. We had enough
data to perform the analysis. In the next visualization, we would show
you the fitness level of the users of the smart devices.

## 5.5. METs

### 5.5.1 Average Minutes Per Intensity Level

We knew that MET values could determine the intensity level, such as,
sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous. We had made a new table
earlier in the previous step, which group the data based on the
intensity level. Below was the average minutes the users spent per
intensity level within 31 days.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Minutes%20per%20Intensity%20Level-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on the chart above, we saw that in average, users were mostly
doing activity with sedentary intensity, followed by light, moderate,
and vigorous intensities. Sedentary included sitting, sleeping, working,
and any activities who were not included to exercises, sports, or
workouts. This explained why sedentary minutes far than the other
intensities, because most of the people used their time mainly for work
(7-9 hours) and then rest, while the other intensities like

- Light intensity included walking at a leisurely pace or standing in
  line at the store
- Moderate intensity included walking briskly, vacuuming, or raking
  leaves.
- Vigorous intensity included walking very quickly, running, taking an
  aerobics class, or shoveling snow

### 5.5.2. Heatmap Of Average MET Per User Over The Month

We could see the clearer result of how much average MET values that each
user had daily over 31 days of observations here.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/MET%20level-1.png)<!-- -->

The more red the tiles, the higher the average MET values; on the other
hand, the more yellow the tiles, the lower the average MET values.
Higher average MET values indicated that the users were more active and
did intense activities that burned more calories. The minimum average
MET value was 1.0. When users had only a 1.0 average MET value per day,
then they could be identified as sedentary.

We saw some of the users were more active than the others. The maximum
average MET value we found was 2.5, and the users that reached this
value had metabolic rate 2.5 times higher than sedentary users. The
higher the MET, the higher the metabolic rate would be.

### 5.5.3. Achieved Status

As a baseline, the NHS recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity
activity a week. This is as well as ‘strengthening activities that work
all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and
arms) on at least 2 days a week.’ But how you fill those activity
minutes is really up to you.

In the chart below, we would see how many times each user successfully
or unsuccessfully achieved weekly target based on the theory. We marked
tiles with oranges to show that the user achieved the target, and with
yellow to show that the user should do more exercise.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Total%20Achieved%20Status-1.png)<!-- -->

We also plotted them into a heatmap chart to see more detailed
information about which week they successfully or failed to achieve the
target.

![](Bellabeat_2024_02_16_v01_files/figure-gfm/Heatmap%20Achievement%20Status-1.png)<!-- -->

We saw that most of the users have achieved the weekly target. Only few
red tiles appeared in the heatmap chart, which was really a good sign.
We could say people who used this smart devices cared about their health
and fitness level in overall. Even though, there were two people in the
chart who probably did not get use to do sports or workouts, so they
have more red tiles than the orange tiles.

## 6. Key Findings

Based on the analysis, we found some key findings as follows:

- Most users were active user, followed by moderate and little numbers
  of light users
- Sometimes people forgot to wear their smart devices
- People used the devices more often on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
- MET was the most reliable variable to define fitness
- In average, users spent their time mostly on sedentary activities,
  followed by light, moderate, and vigorous activities
- Even though, based on the average MET per day, we found some users had
  high average MET, which meant they did more of moderate-vigorous
  intensity activities than the others
- Most of the users achieved their weekly fitness target
- Only two users who did not achieve fitness target more than twice

## 7. Recommendations

- People who bought these smart devices were concerned about their
  health. Sometimes, people forget to wear them, which is not good,
  especially when they want to track all the activities throughout the
  day. The Fitbit smart devices came in smartwatch products, so people
  who did not use to wear watches can easily forget to wear them.
  Somehow, the Bellabeat products produced in the jewelry form, which
  could be clipped or worn as a necklace or bracelet, make the users
  easily wear them, even in bed.
- People might forget to wear their devices when they are charging them.
  It would be a perfect move if the Bellabeat could provide a long-lived
  battery.
- Advertise about the product more on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
- Since Bellabeat wants to target females as main consumers, promote the
  devices more to the females who are concerned or just started to be
  concerned about their health. Bellabeat marketing team can also create
  content that can make females more aware of their health or fitness
  condition.
- Create features that specially made for females, like period calendar
  and pregnancy tracker.
- Give the users activities that best to do to burn calories when they
  are in period or pregnancy.
- Encourage females to do more activities that produce higher MET values
  and notify them when they are doing sedentary activities for too long.
  Recommend them the activities along with the MET values so they can
  choose the activities they love. With that, people can do their
  workouts or activities without getting bored or irritated.
